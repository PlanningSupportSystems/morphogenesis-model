this model is a work in progress of how urban agglomerations might have developed from the begining, before planning, before even hamlets emerged. 
the aim, at this very moment, is to find out which geometric principles and spacial forces allow the emergence of blocks and streets. is it
a purelly geometric, or purelly spatial? a combination of both principles? or are there more domains involved, principles, forces?

the model so far encompasses geometric relations, in the form of distance and relative position, and spatial ones, through isovist principles.
we understood that domain of sight may be a good candidate for this drive, yet if acompanied by geometry rules.

here we have the code under construction, a few images, and the online version of our model.
