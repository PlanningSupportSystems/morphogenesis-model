this model is a work in progress of how urban aglomerations might have developed from the begining, before planning, before hamlets emerged. 
the aim, at this very moment, is to find out which geometric principles and spacial forces allow the emergence of blocks and streets. is it
a combination of principles, is it all so geometric, spatial? or a combination of more domains, principles forces?

the model so far comprehend geometric relations in the form of distance and relative position, and spacial ones, by means of isovist principles.
we understood that domain of sight may be a good candidate for this drive, yet acompanied by geometry rules.

here we have the code under construction, a few images, and the online version of our model.
